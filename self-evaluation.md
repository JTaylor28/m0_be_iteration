# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
* i feel okay, but I think I can use it better than I can explain it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
* well I did it, it was hard to do it fast, but im nothing if not persistent so I completed the tasks regardless. Overall it was a productive struggle.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* My Vocab on this is somewhat shotty. I think ill re-read the assignment page when im less tired.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* More or less, I need to understand the vocab better to uses these new skills more effectivly
